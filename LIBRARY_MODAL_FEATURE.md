# Library Detail Modal Feature

## Overview

Added functionality to open a detailed library modal when clicking on daily duas in the admin calendar.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ New Component: `LibraryDetailModal`

**File:** `src/components/library/LibraryDetailModal.tsx`

A comprehensive modal that displays library item details including:

- **Name and Description** - Main content display
- **Album Tag** - Color-coded album category
- **Arabic Text** - Right-to-left text display (if available)
- **Transliteration** - Romanized text (if available)
- **Translation** - English translation (if available)
- **Audio Player** - Play/stop audio functionality
- **PDF Link** - Open PDF in new tab
- **Video Link** - Open video in new tab
- **Metadata** - Creation and update timestamps

### 2. ✅ Updated: `AdminCalendar.tsx`

#### Added State Management

```typescript
const [libraryModalOpen, setLibraryModalOpen] = useState(false)
const [selectedLibrary, setSelectedLibrary] = useState<Library | null>(null)
```

#### New Handler Function

```typescript
const handleDuaClick = (library: Library, event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  event.stopPropagation()
  setSelectedLibrary(library)
  setLibraryModalOpen(true)
}
```

#### Updated WeekView Component

- Added `onDuaClick` prop to handle dua clicks
- Changed dua click behavior to open library modal instead of daily dua modal
- Maintained "+X more duas" click to open daily dua management

#### Updated Info Modal

- Made daily duas clickable in the date info modal
- Added hover effects for better UX
- Clicking a dua in the modal opens the library detail modal

### 3. ✅ User Experience Improvements

#### In Calendar Grid:

- Click on a single dua badge → Opens library detail modal
- Click on "+X more duas" → Opens daily dua management modal (for adding/removing)
- Hover effect on dua badges for better interactivity

#### In Date Info Modal:

- All duas are clickable
- Hover effect on dua cards
- Smooth transition to library detail modal

## Usage

1. Navigate to Admin Calendar
2. Click on any green dua badge in the calendar grid
3. Library detail modal opens with full content
4. Use the play button to listen to audio (if available)
5. Click PDF/Video links to open in new tab

### Managing Daily Duas

1. Click on "+X more duas" text in calendar
2. OR click the "+ Dua" button on hover (when no duas assigned)
3. Daily Dua management modal opens for adding/removing duas

## Features

### Audio Playback

- Error handling for failed audio loads
- Automatic cleanup when audio ends

### Content Display

## Technical Details

### Props Interface

```typescript
interface LibraryDetailModalProps {
  library: Library | null
  open: boolean
  onClose: () => void
}
```

### Type Safety

- Uses TypeScript with proper type casting
- Handles partial library data gracefully
- Optional chaining for safe property access

### Performance

- Hidden audio element for efficient playback
- Conditional rendering based on data availability
- Event propagation properly managed

## Future Enhancements

3. ✅ Click "+X more duas" → Opens daily dua management
4. ✅ Audio playback works correctly

6. ✅ Modal closes properly with Close button
7. ✅ Event propagation doesn't trigger date selection
